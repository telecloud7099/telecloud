"""Upload session lifecycle: chunk-size detection, session creation, status, and abort.

A session tracks one large-file upload that must be split into multiple Telegram
documents ("parts"). It is durable (stored in Postgres via backend.database) because
a multi-gigabyte upload can span a long time and must survive a backend restart —
see the `FileChunk` / `UploadSession` models for how resume derives entirely from
confirmed chunk rows rather than any separate in-memory state.

# Sized for Cloudflare Tunnel compatibility, not Telegram's own per-document cap (2 GiB /
# 4 GiB) -- Cloudflare's proxy enforces a 100MB request-body limit on Free/Pro plans, and
# that applies to all Tunnel traffic (Quick or Named) with no bypass, since Tunnel traffic
# is always proxied. 80 MiB leaves ~16MB margin under 100MB even if Cloudflare's limit is
# decimal (100,000,000 bytes) rather than binary -- verified this isn't just caution: a
# request within a few hundred KB of a decimal 100,000,000-byte cutoff (e.g. 95 MiB =
# 99,614,720 bytes) would be uncomfortably close given HTTP header overhead. Both free and
# premium Telegram accounts use the same value now since neither approaches the real
# constraint (Cloudflare's proxy) anymore -- it was Telegram's cap that motivated two
# different sizes before. Existing files uploaded at the old, larger sizes remain fully
# downloadable: the download path reads each chunk's actual recorded size from its own
# FileChunk row, never this constant (see chunk_download.py's ChunkPlan).

# instead of the whole file. Small/quick files stay on the plain single-shot endpoint, where
