"""Streaming receive of a single upload-session part: request body -> bounded temp file,
then a background task pushes it to Telegram and records the FileChunk. The PUT returns
as soon as the part is safely on disk ("accepted"), so the browser never holds a request
open for the multi-minute Telegram transfer — it polls GET /uploads/{id} for that leg's
progress instead (see upload_progress.py).

Recovery invariant: the only durable truth is a confirmed FileChunk row. A temp file and
the in-memory progress registry are both disposable — if the process dies mid-part, the
part is simply unconfirmed and the client re-sends it from byte 0 (a retried PUT opens
the temp file in truncate mode). There is no separate crash-recovery state machine.

Chunk-grouping metadata for scan-based recovery (see routes/files.py's _full_scan) is
carried in the message CAPTION, not the filename. Telegram silently rewrites document
filenames that look like a "double extension" (e.g. a `.bin.` middle segment gets every
dot/hyphen replaced with `_`, verified empirically) — captions are plain message text and
are never touched, so they're the only reliable channel for metadata that must survive a
Postgres wipe and be re-derived from Telegram alone.
